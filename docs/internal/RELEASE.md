# Release Flow

The following steps describes the thin-edge.io release process:

1. Trigger the [release workflow](https://github.com/thin-edge/thin-edge.io/actions/workflows/release.yml) in thin-edge.io repository. Select the appropriate version increment (e.g. **patch** for bug fix releases, or **minor** for non-breaking feature releases).

   **Notes**

   * The workflow will create a new [PR](https://github.com/thin-edge/thin-edge.io/pulls) in the repository.

2. Review the [PR](https://github.com/thin-edge/thin-edge.io/pulls) (created in the previous step) and approve

   **Notes**

   When this PR is merged, the [autotag](/.github/workflows/autotag.yml) workflow will detect the change in official version in the Cargo.toml, and then tag the commit with the new version number. This in turn triggers the [build-workflow](https://github.com/thin-edge/thin-edge.io/actions/workflows/build-workflow.yml) yet again to build the artifacts with the official version number.

   During a release, the [build-workflow](https://github.com/thin-edge/thin-edge.io/actions/workflows/build-workflow.yml) will do the following:

   * Create a draft Release
   * Publish the Linux packages to the `tedge-main*` channel in [Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.io/~thinedge/repos/)
   * Promote the Linux packages from `tedge-main*` to `tedge-release*` in [Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.io/~thinedge/repos/)
   * Build and publish container images to the [tedge](https://github.com/thin-edge/thin-edge.io/pkgs/container/tedge) package in the Github container registry
   * Create a PR in the [tedge-docs](https://github.com/thin-edge/tedge-docs/pulls) repository which includes a new snapshot of the docs for the new official version

3. Review the [tedge-docs snapshot PR](https://github.com/thin-edge/tedge-docs/pulls), and approve/merge it

   **Notes**

   You may need to edit the PR before merging. For example, if you also want to remove an existing version in the same PR, then you will have to checkout the PR, make the edits, then push the changes.

   When the PR is merged, it will trigger a new deployment of the [Github Pages](https://github.com/thin-edge/thin-edge.io/actions/workflows/gh-pages.yml) with the option enabled to update the Algolia search index (e.g. by triggering the Algolia crawler).

4. Review the [Github draft release](https://github.com/thin-edge/thin-edge.io/releases) and update the changelog accordingly

5. Publish the [Github release](https://github.com/thin-edge/thin-edge.io/releases) from the previous step.

## Changelog generation

Changelog generation is provided by [git-cliff](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff) combining both commit history and Github PR title and labels.

The following details which information is used to build the changelog:

* The PR title is used as the changelog entry. This allows the title to be modified without having to amend commits.

* Github labels which start with "theme:" are used to set the scope of the PR (e.g. which component the PR is related to), e.g. `theme:software`, `theme:mqtt` etc.

* A PR can be excluded from the changelog by adding the label "skip-release-notes"


### PR Checklist

The following items should be included in PRs to ensure they are ready for changelog generation:

* PR titles are human readable and follow the format:

   ```
   <type>: <description>
   ```

   See [Types](./RELEASE.md#types) for a list of recommended values.

* At least one "theme:*" label should be added to the PR to indicate which components are affected by the PR

#### Types

One of the following types (prefixes) MUST be used:

* feat:
* fix:
* build:
* chore:
* ci:
* docs:
* style:
* refactor:
* perf:
* test:
